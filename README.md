## Overview

This repository will stay in sync with your deployed chats on [v0.app](https://v0.app).
Any changes you make to your deployed app will be automatically pushed to this repository from [v0.app](https://v0.app).

## Deployment

Your project is live at:

**[https://vercel.com/clashofmbm2000-5163s-projects/v0-dhaka-election-heatmap](https://vercel.com/clashofmbm2000-5163s-projects/v0-dhaka-election-heatmap)**

## Build your app
### Local development

Use the development server which runs hot reload and other dev tooling:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

### Production build & start

You must build the app before starting the production server. You can either run:

```powershell
npm run build
npm start
```

or use `npm start` directly (it will run `npm run build` automatically before starting):

```powershell
npm start
```

Note: `npm start` now runs a prestart build step to simplify starting production locally.

### Running locally while editing

When actively editing the app, run the development server which supports Fast Refresh and will show changes instantly (no rebuild needed):

```powershell
npm run dev
```

If you prefer a friendly alias that mirrors `npm start`, use:

```powershell
npm run start:local
```

Avoid running `npm start` while editing — `npm start` is intended for production and will not hot-reload your local changes (it runs a one-time build then serves a static server). If you do run `npm start`, you must rebuild (or restart) to see your edits.
